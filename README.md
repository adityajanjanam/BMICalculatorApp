## BMI Calculator App

This is a simple mobile application built using **React Native** that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI). The app takes height and weight as input and allows the user to select between two measurement systems: SI units (kilograms and centimeters) and Imperial units (pounds and inches). Based on the input, the app calculates the BMI and displays the result, categorizing the BMI into specific intervals (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.).

### Features
- **Input Options**: Users can select between **SI units** and **Imperial units** for height and weight measurements.
- **BMI Calculation**: Based on the inputs, the app calculates the Body Mass Index using standard formulas.
- **BMI Categories**: After calculating the BMI, the app displays a result with corresponding categories:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple, easy-to-use interface for quick BMI calculations.

### How to Use
1. Select your preferred measurement system (SI or Imperial).
2. Enter your **height** and **weight** in the appropriate fields.
3. Tap the "Calculate" button to see your BMI result and its category.

### Technologies Used
- **React Native** for building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** for logic implementation.
  
### Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityajanjanam/BMICalculatorApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
